# CMS
Content management system with html, css, bootstrap in the frontend and PHP in the backend.
In this system, the admin/owner of the system is able to perform the following actions:
- Create Post(Which include both text and picture)
- Edit post
- Delete post
- Create a draft post, which he can later decide to post it, edit it, or delete it.
The users of this content management system will be able to perform the following actions:
- Create accounts
- Login into their accounts
- View posts
- Like posts
- Comment on posts
Users can also view, comment and like posts without registering into the system. But those users who actually register into the system, could get special treats from the admin/owner, like giveaways, newsletters and so on.
This Application can be particularly useful to individuals who are thinking of starting a blog or just a platform to create content of their own and get reviews from a particular audience.
Still need to come back to this and complete it.
